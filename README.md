# data-structures-and-algorithms
Lately, I've been studying data-structure, so I created this repository where I have exercises and notes about it.

Most part of the materials of this repository come from a course I'm taking, it's called [Master the Coding Interview](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/).
